# Summary

### Single responsibility principle.
- A class should only have on reason to change.
- Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent
tasks/problems.
- Example: [code](./SRP.swift)
### Open-Closed priciple.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modificatio.
- Example: [code](./OCP.swift)
### Liskov substition principle.
- You should be able to substitute a base type  for subtype.
- Example: [code](./LSP.swift)
### Interface segregation principle.
- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interface.
- YAGNI - you ain't going to need it.
- Example: [code](./ISP.swift)
### Dependency inversion principle.
- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions.
- Example: [code](./DIP.swift)
