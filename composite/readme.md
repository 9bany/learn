## Motivation
- Objects use other object's properties / members through inheritance and composition.
- Composition lets us make compound objects
- Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly.
## Summary
- Objects can use other objects via inheritance/composition
- Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors
- Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects uniformly
- Swift has special support for the sequence concept
- A simple object an masquerade as a collection with an iterator that uses [self]
