## SQL
### 183. Customers Who Never Order

#### Table: Customers
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
```
#### Table: Orders
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
```
Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```
#### Code
```sql
SELECT A.Name as Customers 
From Customers A
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT B.CustomerId From Orders B WHERE B.CustomerId = A.Id)
```

### 196. Delete Duplicate Emails
#### Table: Person
 
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
```

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The query result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
```

#### Code

```sql
--  Please write a DELETE statement and DO NOT write a SELECT statement.
--  Write your MySQL query statement below

--  sample 
DELETE p1 
    FROM Person p1, Person p2 
    WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email and p1.Id > p2.Id;
-- user INNER JOIN
DELETE p 
    FROM Person p 
    INNER JOIN Person p1 ON p.Email = p1.Email and p.Id > p1.Id;
```



#### Table: World
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | int     |
+-------------+---------+
name is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
```

A country is big if:

it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: 
World table:
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-------------+------------+---------+
| name        | population | area    |
+-------------+------------+---------+
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
+-------------+------------+---------+

```

#### Code 
```sql
--  Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name, population, area 
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 or population >= 25000000;
```


### 584. Find Customer Referee
#### Table: Customer
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
```

Write an SQL query to report the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: 
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```
#### Code

```sql
SELECT name FROM Customer WHERE referee_id <> 2 or referee_id IS NULL;
```

### 595. Big Countries
### 627. Swap Salary
#### Table: Salary
```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| sex         | ENUM     |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
The sex column is ENUM value of type ('m', 'f').
The table contains information about an employee.
```

Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.

The query result format is in the following example.
#### Example 1:


```
Input: 
Salary table:
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+
Output: 
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+
Explanation: 
(1, A) and (3, C) were changed from 'm' to 'f'.
(2, B) and (4, D) were changed from 'f' to 'm'.
```

#### Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
UPDATE salary  
    SET sex = (
        CASE 
            WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f' 
            ELSE 'm' 
        END)
```

### 1484. Group Sold Products By The Date

#### Table Activities:

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.
```

Write an SQL query to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by `sell_date`.

The query result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:


```
Input: 
Activities table:
+------------+------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |

| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |
+------------+------------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
Explanation: 
For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.
```
#### Code

```sql
SELECT sell_date, count(distinct product) AS num_sold,
group_concat(distinct product order by product asc) as products
from Activities
group by sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
```

### 1667. Fix Names in a Table

#### Table: Users

```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.
```

Write an SQL query to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |

+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
+---------+-------+
```

#### Code 

```sql
SELECT user_id, concat(upper(left(name, 1)), lower(substring(name, 2))) as name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id;
```

### 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products
#### Table: Products
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
```

Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

```
Input: 
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.
```
#### Code
```sql
SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE low_fats = 'Y' and recyclable = 'Y';
```

### 1873. Calculate Special Bonus
#### Table: Employees
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
```

Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is `100%` of their salary if the ID of the employee is **an odd number** and **the employee name does not start with the character** `'M'`. The bonus of an employee is `0` otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The query result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |
+-------------+---------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+-------+
| employee_id | bonus |
+-------------+-------+
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |
+-------------+-------+
Explanation: 
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.
```

#### Code
```sql

SELECT employee_id, 
    IF(employee_id % 2 != 0 and SUBSTRING(name, 1, 1) != 'M', salary, 0) AS bonus 
FROM Employees 
ORDER BY employee_id ASC;

```
